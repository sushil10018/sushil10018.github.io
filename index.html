  <h1>Sushil Shrestha</h1>
  <h2>Ruby Developer From Nepal</h2>
  <p>I'm a web developer with an ideal blend of skill in visual design and proficiency with technology.</p>
  <h2>My Story</h2>
  <p>After graphic designing for a year at the age of 16, I’ve gained an experience of 5 years as a web-designer/developer. I am a Ruby developer from Nepal with an ideal blend of skill in visual design and proficiency with technology, I’m a quick-learner technophile and timing is the best part of me. An academic degree of BScIT makes me more comfortable with programming.</p>
  <h2>Work and Education</h2>
  <p>An enthusiastic start and a clean finish as my goal, I’ve been working as a Ruby Developer in Nepal for around a year. With the experience of working as a PSD developer for a year and a half, a HTML/CSS/JS developer for over a year and an excellent academic record, I’ve gained all-round professional qualifications in this field. Keeping in mind that managerial skills are also very crucial, I’ve led a team of 5 professionals in a project to redesign 300 WordPress sites in 7 different themes within a minimum period of just 8 months with great success and appreciation. In spite of these academics, qualifications and experiences, I still see myself as a beginner and have a keen urge to learn more as LEARNING IS ENDLESS.</p>
